I connected with Aarohi and explained my script analysis to her. However, she still has some questions, including:  

1. How is the **Posted Payment File** generated, and how does its code work within the script?  
2. How are we loading the **BAI2 file**?  
3. When **TYPE CODE 88** is read, she wants a line-by-line explanation of the logic written inside it.  

Overall, she wants to understand the complete job flow along with the script.  

I will work on this tomorrow and will need some time to complete it.
