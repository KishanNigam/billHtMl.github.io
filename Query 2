During the daily call with Aarohi, she mentioned that we have some options to replicate the same issue that occurred in production in the test environment for unit testing. She asked to connect with Pavan and Divya for this.  

Because of this, I havenâ€™t reached out to the DB team today. First, I want to connect with Divya and Pavan to discuss the issue.
