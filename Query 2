Change Identification and Description

Request:
The request is to update the existing script to exclude payments from APSFC and APSFE sources so that the daily report is generated for the remaining sources only.

Existing Process Overview

1. Purpose:
The current process involves executing the OFAC compliance check to identify payments associated with individuals/entities flagged by the US Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).


2. Execution Flow:

A batch file (RUN_OFAC.BAT) is executed.

This batch file invokes the VBScript OFAC_EXPORT.VBS.

The VBScript performs operations and logs the output into a log file.

Errors, if any, are emailed to the designated recipients.



3. Current Query Logic:

The query fetches distinct transaction details, including COMPANY_CODE, SOURCE_CODE, CHECK_NUMBER, CHECK_AMT, VENDOR_NAME, and REMIT_GEN_NAME.

A condition ensures that transactions from specific source codes (APDCC, APRUC, APRCC) are excluded using the NOT IN clause.

Transactions already processed by the OFAC system are also excluded.





---

Proposed Change

Update:
Modify the query in the script to include two additional source codes (APSFC and APSFE) in the NOT IN clause, ensuring these sources are excluded from the report.

Expected Behavior:

Payments originating from the APSFC and APSFE sources will no longer appear in the daily report.

The report will continue to include transactions from all other sources, excluding those already listed in the NOT IN clause or processed by OFAC.

Code Changes Required

Updated Query:
The NOT IN clause in the existing query will be updated as follows:

AND D.SOURCE_CODE NOT IN ('APDCC', 'APRUC', 'APRCC', 'APSFC', 'APSFE')

Modified Code Block:

sQuery="SELECT DISTINCT " & _ 
              "SUBSTRING(C.COMPANY_CODE, 1, 5) + " & _
              "SUBSTRING(D.SOURCE_CODE, 1, 5) + " & _
              "SUBSTRING(A.CHECK_NUMBER,1,11) + " & _
              "REPLACE(STR(CHECK_AMT,15,2),' ', '0') + " & _
              "SUBSTRING(C.VENDOR_NAME1, 1, 60) + " & _
              "SUBSTRING(CAST(E.REMIT_GEN_NAME2 AS CHAR(60)), 1, 60) AS DATA_FIELD " & _
         "FROM XPORT_AP_TRIGGER A, AP_BSTRN_HEADER C, BSTRN_HEADER D, AP_REMIT_ADDR E " & _
        "WHERE A.BANK                = C.BANK " & _
          "AND ((C.CHECK_NUMBER        = A.CHECK_NUMBER AND " & _
                "A.CHECK_RECON_STATUS IN ('O')) OR " & _
               "(C.EFT_ADVICE_NUM     = A.CHECK_NUMBER AND " & _
                "A.CHECK_RECON_STATUS IN ('C'))) " & _
          "AND A.BANK_ACCOUNT        = C.BANK_ACCOUNT " & _
          "AND C.TRAN_ID             = D.TRAN_ID " & _
          "AND C.TRAN_ID             = E.TRAN_ID " & _
          "AND D.SOURCE_CODE NOT IN ('APDCC','APRUC','APRCC','APSFC','APSFE') " & _
          "AND NOT EXISTS " & _
          "( SELECT * FROM XPORT_AP_CONTROL D " & _
             "WHERE D.XPORT_AP_ID    = A.XPORT_AP_ID " & _
               "AND D.EXPORT_PROCESS = 'OFAC') "

Impact Analysis

1. Functionality Impact:

Excluding APSFC and APSFE payments ensures compliance with the new reporting requirement.

No adverse impact on the logic or functionality of the script, as it simply expands the exclusion list.



2. Performance Impact:

Minimal performance impact, as the NOT IN clause is efficiently handled by most database engines.

The expanded exclusion list does not significantly alter the complexity of the query.



3. Error Handling:

No changes in error handling mechanisms. Errors, if any, will continue to be logged and emailed to recipients.





---

Testing Requirements

1. Unit Testing:

Test the updated script to ensure APSFC and APSFE payments are excluded.

Validate inclusion of payments from other source codes.



2. Integration Testing:

Execute the batch file and confirm successful generation of the daily report.

Verify the log file for any unexpected errors.



3. Regression Testing:

Ensure existing functionality remains unaffected, especially for other excluded source codes and OFAC-processed transactions.



4. Error Scenario Testing:

Validate the behavior when errors occur in script execution or database connectivity.

Deliverables

1. Updated VBScript with the modified query.


2. Test case documentation for validation.


3. Test results report confirming the successful implementation of the change.

Conclusion

The proposed change is straightforward and low-risk, involving only a minor modification to the query logic. The implementation will ensure compliance with the updated reporting requirements while maintaining existing functionality.
