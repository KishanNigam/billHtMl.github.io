I have made the required changes in the code based on the CIA requirements. Now, for the source **APCNC, APRTV, CLM-A, and CLM-D**, the XML will display the **Beneficiary Bank Account** value instead of the IBAN Code.  

I have attached the **updated VB script, Unit Testing document, and Code Comparison document**. Kindly review them.
