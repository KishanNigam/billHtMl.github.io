Script Structure and Mechanism
Date and Time Initialization

Generates timestamps (sDate, RPTDATE) with zero-padded month, day, hour, and minute values for use in file paths and log file naming.
Uses helper functions ZeroFill and BLANKFill to pad values.
Parameter Validation

Checks if required arguments (Execserver, VersionKey) are passed.
Exits with an error message if arguments are missing.
File Path and Log Initialization

Constructs paths for:
Source File: Based on Execserver and a static directory structure.
Log File: Includes the current year, month, and timestamp for unique naming.
Creates a log file and starts logging script actions and progress.
Reading Registry Values

Reads database connection details (DBServerVal, DBDBVal, etc.) from RegistryDtls.txt.
Utilizes ReadReg function to fetch registry values based on parsed keys.
Reading Source File

Reads Session_lock.txt line by line.
Extracts JOB_ID and LOCK_SESSION_ID values, logging each fetched value.
Database Connection

Establishes a connection to the SQL Server database using ADODB with ODBC Driver 17.
Specifies the connection string, including encryption and credentials.
SQL Query Execution

Update Query: Updates STATUS_IND to 300 in the EAS_JOBS table if JOB_ID is valid.
Delete Query: Deletes a record from the EAS_LOCKS table if LOCK_SESSION_ID is valid.
Logs every query execution, including success or failure.
Error Handling

Logs and exits gracefully in case of missing or invalid JOB_ID or LOCK_SESSION_ID.
Logs query results, whether successful or erroneous.
Clean-Up and Exit

Closes database connections and log file before exiting the script.
Error Handling Points
Source File Availability

Ensures Session_lock.txt exists in EASFilePath.
If not found, logs "Source file is not available or Source file name is not correct." and exits.
Parameter Check

Exits with "Missing parameters" if no arguments are passed.
Registry Value Errors

Validates parsed values from RegistryDtls.txt. If any value is missing or VersionKey is invalid, logs the issue and skips further execution.
Database Connection Failures

Wraps the db.Open method in error-handling logic to log failures:
"Database Issue: Unable to connect to the database."
Ends the script if the connection cannot be established.
Query Execution Errors

Catches and logs errors during SQL execution:
Logs the query being executed for debugging.
Reports specific database errors, such as syntax issues or missing table/column definitions.
Invalid Source File Data

Checks if JOB_ID and LOCK_SESSION_ID are missing or malformed.
Logs "Error: JOB_ID is wrong!" or "Error: LOCK_SESSION_ID is wrong!" based on the issue.
