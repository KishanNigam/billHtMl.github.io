sQuery="SELECT DISTINCT " & _ 
              "SUBSTRING(C.COMPANY_CODE, 1, 5) + " & _
              "SUBSTRING(D.SOURCE_CODE, 1, 5) + " & _
              "SUBSTRING(A.CHECK_NUMBER,1,11) + " & _
              "REPLACE(STR(CHECK_AMT,15,2),' ', '0') + " & _
              "SUBSTRING(C.VENDOR_NAME1, 1, 60) + " & _
              "SUBSTRING(CAST(E.REMIT_GEN_NAME2 AS CHAR(60)), 1, 60) AS DATA_FIELD " & _
         "FROM XPORT_AP_TRIGGER A, AP_BSTRN_HEADER C, BSTRN_HEADER D, AP_REMIT_ADDR E " & _
        "WHERE A.BANK                = C.BANK " & _
          "AND ((C.CHECK_NUMBER        = A.CHECK_NUMBER AND " & _

          "AND D.SOURCE_CODE NOT IN ('APDCC','APRUC','APRCC','APSFC','APSFE') " & _
          "AND NOT EXISTS " & _
          "( SELECT * FROM XPORT_AP_CONTROL D " & _
             "WHERE D.XPORT_AP_ID    = A.XPORT_AP_ID " & _
