I have analyzed the VC task and found that the Scan 2 task, which reads EXIT code 99 on a database connection failure, calls the Error 8 task, which sends an email with the APPAY.log attached.

However, as you can see below, apart from checking EXIT code 99, there are several other conditions as well. If we remove APPAY.log from the Error 8 task and send only the VC log, it will apply by default to all these conditions, and in case any of them are true, the email will contain only the VC log.

Please analyze the impact of these conditions and let me know what should be done next.
