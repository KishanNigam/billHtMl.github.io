Script Objective:
To validate the transactions loaded into the EAS main system, the bank sends a file commonly referred to as a BAI2 file. This file contains details of payments that have been cleared.

Through this script, data from the received BAI2 file is extracted and verified in the database. Based on the TCODE provided in the BAI2 file, the script generates three files:

RRNG file

Posted file

Outstanding file

The RRNG file is then loaded into the EAS system. As a result, the transactions that have been cleared are moved from the "Outstanding" status to the "Cleared" status in the system.
