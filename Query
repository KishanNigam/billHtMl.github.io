"I have completed the technical analysis and will attach the document to DevOps tomorrow. Based on the requirements, I have created the batch file and performed local sanity checks. I have also created the Visual Cron job. 

Due to a production issue, I was unable to deploy today. I will deploy the batch file in the Test environment tomorrow and start working on unit testing."
