Subject: Analysis and Next Steps

Hi Team,

Based on my analysis, I have compared the production and test jobs, and I did not find any differences between them. I have also attached the comparison document for your review.

Kindly review the document.

Since Desiree is on leave, Aarohi and I will discuss this with her on Monday and explore the solution for copying the production job to UAT.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Subject: Follow-Up on Insurance Policy Queries

Hi Ms. Dipa,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am following up on my previous email regarding some queries related to the insurance policy. For your reference, I have outlined the queries again below:

1. What is the procedure for applying for an insurance claim?


2. Is there any way to get an insurance card or registration number as a soft copy (e.g., Ayushman card)?


3. Could you please confirm the members currently added to my insurance policy?


4. What is the procedure for adding a member to the policy?



Your guidance on these points would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if you require any additional information from my side to assist with the queries.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you,
Kishan Nigam
