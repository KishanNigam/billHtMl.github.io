Technical Analysis Document

Change Request:
Configure VisualCron to send failure notifications when the condition "RECORD(S) REJECTED" is encountered.

Analysis:

1. Current Setup:

VisualCron has multiple tasks; Scan 3 Task reads the batch log.



2. Proposed Solution:

Modify Scan 3 Task to check for the condition "RECORD(S) REJECTED" in the log.

Trigger job failure when the condition is met.

Configure an error notification email for job failure.




Implementation Steps:

1. Edit the Scan 3 Task to include the new condition.


2. Add failure state and email notification for the job.



Impact:

Technical: Minimal workflow changes.

Business: Improved monitoring and issue notification.


Assumptions:

Batch log format remains consistent.


Next Steps:

Implement and test changes in a non-production environment.
