Hi Brian ,

This is regarding the service request raised by Kishan for creating an Associated PROD SFTP connection on Visual Cron “REQ0098064” which you have completed and gave the public key so that the vendor can place at their end.

Upon checking with Vendor , they are setting up new credentials and will discard the existing SFTP credentials .So , we can’t proceed with the connection created and the user story is put on hold.

So, Vendor have asked the below information which will help them to setup a new credential .

Information Request
•	For whitelisting purposes, we will need all IP address(es) that will be connecting to host address from your organization.
•	Identify if you will connect using Host addresses or IP addresses . 
•	Be able to confirm file name(s) sent to or received from Associated Bank-     (PDBAI*.txt) – the filename(s) starting with text “PDBAI“.


Please can you provide the above information ( I have provided the 3rd information) , so that we can send it to Associated bank(vendor) and they have informed us that once they get the above information , they will create the new credentials and send it to us .

So , just to clarify ,  after the vendor sends the new credential you would be creating a new Associated PROD SFTP Visual Cron connection, and a new service request has to be raised from our end to do it and after creating the connection on VC ,you would be sending a new public key which we need to send it to Vendor .. Is my understanding correct ? or am I missing something ? Please Let me know.
