Hi Cris,

This is regarding the FSU pipeline:

I attempted to delete a file and commit the code, but the file is not being deleted. It seems that after cloning the repository, the solution file is not being generated. This might be causing the issue where files intended for deletion remain present even after committing and deploying via Octopus.

For reference, please check pull request 3242, where Lauren attempted modifications in two files and tried deleting one. While the modifications were successful, the deleted file still exists.

Could you please look into this issue? If needed, I am available to connect over a meeting to discuss further.
