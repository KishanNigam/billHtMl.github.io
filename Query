Traslate in english in office wording in formal way.

we have received multiple failure in NICOEAS10. Due to folder access related issue.


Error:
Access to the path '\\nicoad\nico\Finance\FSD\Finance\AccountsPayable\APBHSIC\EFTS\APGEFT.TXT' is denied.


Looks like there is permission change to this folder and other user are also facing to access this `AccountsPayable`. 

We have to close this incident beacuse  Paul worked on this on same  issue on the incident INC0170231 . 


Here's the formal translation in office wording:

---

We have encountered multiple failures in NICOEAS10 due to folder access issues.

Error:
Access to the path '\\nicoad\nico\Finance\FSD\Finance\AccountsPayable\APBHSIC\EFTS\APGEFT.TXT' is denied.

It appears there has been a change in the permissions for this folder, and other users are also experiencing difficulties accessing `AccountsPayable`. 

We need to close this incident because Paul has already addressed the same issue under incident INC0170231.

Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to modify!
