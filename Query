Based on my technical analysis, I have some questions regarding the VC changes, as they have impacted other conditions. I have sent a detailed email to Pavan and the BA team for further clarification.

2. During the walkthrough of the VNDLY EXPORT job, the following code change was required:

The export file was not displaying two decimal places for the amount fields. The development team has implemented a quick fix for this issue, and the QA team will share the testing screenshots with this group for sign-off.
The code changes have been completed, and the updated VBScript file has been attached in DevOps.

3. There is a condition where, when multiple files arrive and all files are loaded successfully, VC should send a success email. Currently, this condition is not working as expected.

I need a quick discussion with Pavan to address this issue. Please let me know a suitable time.



Brian created the connection and sent the public key. I verified the connection but received a connection error. I reached out to Brian regarding the issue, and he mentioned that we need to provide the public key to the other end. They need to configure their SFTP server to accept SSH key authentication.

"Aarohi connected with us and suggested analyzing the technical feasibility of this user story. We then began analyzing the RRNG job.

During the analysis, we reviewed the RRNG job using the VC log, BAT log, and SSMS. We identified some mapping of the loaded file. Aarohi now wants to schedule a connect with the development team to discuss further."
