Sir I have a some Points

1. I have delivered the handle lock user story on Tuesday
2. I have completed my Sysdata users story on Thursday. 
3. On Friday, Pavan is on leave, I picked remain Sysdata user story which was assigned to Abhisek which also completed.

On the friday's user story we have some feedback review where only 2-3 lines changes required. 

My point is why pavan said that over call i am delaying my work.
