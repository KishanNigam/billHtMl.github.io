Here's the translation in office terminology:

"FYI, Lauren assigned me to deploy a stored procedure (SP) that required adding dynamic database logic, which I completed. Additionally, I had to make some changes to the query while testing the SP and creating the dynamic elements. As a result, I spent most of my time today on this task and couldn't dedicate as much time to my other tasks."
