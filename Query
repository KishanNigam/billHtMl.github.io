I have added all 6 BU_CODEs as filters and further optimized the query, and connected with Aarohi. We discussed that Desiree wants only the BU_CODEs entered by the user to be displayed in the SP; otherwise, the BU_CODE should not appear in the column, even if its value is NULL. Therefore, I am working on the SP based on the provided update and plan to complete it by EOD tomorrow.
