"I have performed a high-level SQL data comparison with the file shared by Ashley, and the data matches. Additionally, I have deployed the updated `TrialBalance_2basis` stored procedure, which was successfully deployed in both Test and UAT environments. Now, I am waiting for it to be deployed in Production. Once the stored procedure is deployed in Production, I will configure it in the user Excel file and compare the data with Ashley's file."
