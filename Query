"Due to changes in the stored procedure parameters, we encountered an error in the old Excel file for `TrialBalance_2basis`. Upon analysis, we found that in the updated stored procedure, the `@Company_Code` variable had been replaced with `@Company`. 

The error has been fixed, and the stored procedure has been successfully redeployed to production. Both the 2-basis Excel file and the 3-basis file for three companies have been tested, and everything is functioning correctly."
