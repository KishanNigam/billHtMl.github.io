Describe the Change Being Requested:
Request here is to get job failure notification for condition “RECORD(S) REJECTED” in VisualCron.
Analysis:
•	In the Visual Cron go through all the scan tasks.
•	Scan 3 task is reading batch log.
•	So, I have to apply conditions in scan 3 task.
•	Every time job will fail due to RECORD(S) REJECTED. Job send a error mail.
