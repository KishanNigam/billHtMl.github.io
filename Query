Aaj hame Do job fail receive hui NICOEAS10 ki phele job AP BHSIC CHECKS IMPORT and Dusri AP BHSIC EFTs Import. Jiske analysis karne par hame pata chala ki NICOEAS10 ke VC ke service account main folder access permission ka issue hai. Jishke liye hamne Paul ko reach out kiya or ushe dono incident pe kam karne ke lie assign kar diya.

Sath hee main desiree ka hamare pass instruction aya ki ham Scott's team se file lekar ERIN ya fir Kathy ko file de or unhe EAS main manually load krne ke instruction bata de. So Maine or Aarohi ne Kelsey se connect kiya or ushe manually load karane ka try kiya but hame load karna main ek error aa rhi thi. Sath main hee Paul ne VC main account service configuration set hone ki confirmation de jiske baad. Aarohi ne Phele Kelsy se EFT file or Check file ko source location main rakhne ko bola but ushke away dikhne ke karan Aarohi ne Kethy se bhi source file ko source location main place karne ko bola. Same time pe dono ne hee file ko place kar diya jishke wajha se check ka data NICOEAS10 prod main do baar load ho gaya. 

Solution ke liye maine ERIN or Kelsy ko mail kiya hai ki wo duplicate data ko delete kare.

   - Today, we received two job failures from NICOEAS10:

   - We contacted Paul and assigned both incidents to him for resolution.

4. **Additional Instructions**:  
   - We received instructions from Desiree to obtain the file from Scott's team and provide it to Erin or Kathy, along with guidance to manually load it into EAS.

5. **Manual Loading Attempt**:  
   - Aarohi and I connected with Kelsey and attempted to load the file manually, but an error occurred.

6. **Service Configuration Confirmation**:  
   - Paul confirmed that the VC account service configuration was set correctly.

7. **File Placement Actions**:  
   - Aarohi first asked Kelsey to place the EFT file and the Check file in the source location.
