Here's the formal English version of your paragraph, structured clearly for inclusion in an office document:

---

**Job Process Flow:**

1. The **Payment Transaction Feed** file is loaded into the EAS system through the **DC Import Job**, or occasionally created manually.  
2. The transaction status is updated from **'W' (Waiting)** to **'D' (Processed)** through payment processing.  
3. Once the payment is successfully processed, an **XML file** is generated for the respective transaction.  
4. The **bank retrieves** the XML file.  
5. The bank then places an **encrypted BAI2 file** on the **SFTP site** for validation purposes.  
6. The job **"HSBC SFTP PROD - BAI2 File Download Control"** downloads the BAI2 file from the SFTP site, decrypts it, and places it in a specified **network location**.  
7. The job **"HSBC BAI2 IMPORT – International"** picks the file from the network location and invokes a batch file.  
8. The **batch file renames** the downloaded file from the format `BAI2*.BAI` to `HSBC_BAI2.txt` and moves it to the designated **import location**.  
9. The batch file then calls a **VBScript**.  
10. The **script reads** the BAI2 file line by line and generates three output files:  
    a. **RRNG File** – Contains details of cleared payments, which are loaded into the EAS system.  
    b. **POSTED_HSBC_PAYMENTS_YYMMDD.CSV** – Contains data of transactions that have been cleared.  
    c. **Outstanding_HSBC_PAYMENT.CSV** – Contains data of all outstanding transactions.  
11. The **RRNG file** is placed in the RRNG location, after which the batch file executes **RRNG.exe** to load the RRNG data into the EAS system.
