Hereâ€™s a corrected and polished version of your status update for your manager:  

**293256 - Investigation of Errors in the Currency Extract Process**  
The analysis of the table and query has been completed for both scripts. I am currently documenting my findings and will schedule a call with Aarohi tomorrow to discuss them.  

**413711 & 413712 - Using the Original Filename When Calling RRNG.exe**  
I have completed unit testing for both jobs and have attached the relevant documents for your reference.  

Let me know if you need any further refinements!
