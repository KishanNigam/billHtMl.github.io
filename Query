The summary job failed on the UAT server because someone manually stopped the job from the Spotlight application, and we did not receive any error notification. To address this, we have added conditions for this type of issue in Visual Cron.

To verify the condition, we need to kill the session from the Spotlight application. The steps for validating the notification error are as follows:

After the summary job was triggered in UAT, we raised a service ticket (REQ0083559) for the DBA team to kill the session.
We raised a ticket and emailed the DBA team, and then reached out to Bill on Microsoft Teams to have the session killed.
After the session was killed, the summary job failed successfully, and the VC failure condition was successfully validated. I have attached the email for further information
