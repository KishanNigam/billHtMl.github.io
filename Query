BCDBCM and BCDB Cash Import are part of sprint 23 as I have discussed in Handover connect and I have told that scripts are ready and add only the Auto Approval part . You no need to check on the script level that is taken care.. Since , we are doing Moola I wanted to finish these two also in this sprint only and as far BA is concerned , their CA will not available until next Sprint. Please add the auto approval part and perform unit testing.

I Agree sir, I have already added auto approval task in VC. During the testing I have just faced issue when I load the file the transaction gone in error. So I send a query to BA for support. As you know Divya and Rohit is unavailable yesterday.
