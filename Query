Subject: Queries Regarding Insurance Policy

Hi Ms. Dipa,

My name is Kishan Nigam (EMP ID: 3905), and I am an employee of Xceedance Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. I have a few queries regarding the insurance policy:

1. What is the procedure for applying for an insurance claim?


2. Is there any way to get an insurance card or registration number as a soft copy (e.g., Ayushman card)?


3. Could you please confirm the members currently added to my insurance policy?


4. What is the procedure for adding a member to the policy?



Your guidance on these points would be very helpful for me.

Looking forward to your response.
