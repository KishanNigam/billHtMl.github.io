The summery job failed on the UAT server because someone manually stopped the job from spotlight application and we did not receive any error notification. 
To fix this, we have added conditions for that type of issue in Visual Cron. 

To verify the condition, we need to kill the session from the spotlight application,

So, below are the steps of validation of notification error.

1. After the summery job was triggered in UAT, we raised a service ticket - REQ0083559 for the DBA team to
 kill the session.
2. Raised a ticket and emailed the DBA team, and then reached out to Bill on team to have the session killed.
3. After the session is killed, the summery job fails successfully and VC failure condition is successfully validated. I have attached the email for further information.
