Traslate in english in office wording in formal way.

we have received multiple failure in NICOEAS10. Due to folder access related issue.


Error:
Access to the path '\\nicoad\nico\Finance\FSD\Finance\AccountsPayable\APBHSIC\EFTS\APGEFT.TXT' is denied.


Looks like there is permission change to this folder and other user are also facing to access this `AccountsPayable`. 

We have to close this incident beacuse  Paul worked on this on same  issue on the incident INC0170231 .
