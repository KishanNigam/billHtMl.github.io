BCDBCM and BCDB Cash Import are part of sprint 23 as I have discussed in Handover connect and I have told that scripts are ready and add only the Auto Approval part . You no need to check on the script level that is taken care.. Since , we are doing Moola I wanted to finish these two also in this sprint only and as far BA is concerned , their CA will not available until next Sprint. Please add the auto approval part and perform unit testing.

I Agree sir, I have already added auto approval task in VC. During the testing I have just faced issue when I load the file the transaction gone in error. So I send a query to BA for support. As you know Divya and Rohit is unavailable yesterday.

**Subject:** Update on Auto Approval Task  

Dear [Tech Lead's Name],  

I agree, sir. I have already added the auto-approval task in VC. However, during testing, I encountered an issue where the transaction went into an error state when loading the file. I have raised a query with the BA team for their support on this. As you are aware, both Divya and Rohit were unavailable yesterday, which caused a slight delay in resolving the issue.  

Please let me know if you would like me to proceed in a specific direction or prioritize any additional tasks.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
