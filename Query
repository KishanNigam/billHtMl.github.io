Hereâ€™s a more formal version with improved structure and clarity:  

---

1. **Start the Script**  
2. Assign `CurrExtract.TXT` file to the object variable.  
3. **Start Select Query**  
   a. Select data from `XPORT_GL_TRIGGER` where `Source Code` is NOT IN ('IDTS', 'INVST', 'JE', 'INSM', 'APRUC', 'SRRU', 'PURGE', 'CORP') for `COMPANY: NLFCA`.  
   b. Verify that the data is not present in the `XPORT_GL_CONTROL` table.  
   c. Add `0` to the `REFERENCE_DATA` column during data selection.  
4. Assign the selected data to a predefined variable and write it to a `.txt` file.  
5. Insert the selected data into the `XPORT_GL_CONTROL` table.  
6. **End the Script**  
7. **Start the Batch File**  
8. Pass the `.txt` file and `.srt` file to `cmsort.exe` for execution.  
   a. `cmsort.exe` copies data from the `.txt` file to the `.srt` file and sorts the data based on the transaction date.  
9. Execute `RRNG.exe`, which picks the `.srt` file and loads the data as a JE transaction (creating a JE transaction from `NLFCA` to `NCBUS`).  
10. Call `VALDLOAD`.  
11. **End the Batch File**
