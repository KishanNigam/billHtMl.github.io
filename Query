Good question, Aarohi. I have added scenarios for multiple job runs and the behavior of logs generated during these runs to my unit testing.

Here is the latest update:
@Pavan, during testing, the job is repeatedly failing. Upon debugging, I observed that the notification error log shows the server message 2-3 times with the 'error message.' As VC picks up the error message from the batch log and VB script log, I did not find anything in the batch log and script log during my debugging where the server is repeating. Due to other tasks, I have not been able to resolve this issue yet, but I will continue addressing this error tomorrow.
