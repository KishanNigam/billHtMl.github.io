I wanted to clarify a few points about my recent work:

I delivered the Handle Lock user story on Tuesday.
I completed my assigned Sysdata user story on Thursday.
On Friday, since Pavan was on leave, I picked up the remaining Sysdata user story assigned to Abhisek and completed it as well. If this had been completed earlier in the day, it would have been ready to hand over to QA by now.
The feedback for Friday’s user story involved only 2-3 lines of changes, which I addressed immediately.

I’m unsure why Pavan mentioned on the call that I’m delaying my work. All my updates and completion timelines are documented in my handover emails and DevOps comments, which can be reviewed.
