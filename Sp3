After analyzing the scenarios provided by Aarohi and discussing in todayâ€™s call, we have decided to proceed by manually passing the session lock ID in EAS_LOCK and updating the status in the EAS_JOBS table as needed.

I am currently working on the technical document, where I will define all possible cases. Additionally, I am working on the adhoc development for this task. I will aim to complete both the technical documentation and development by Thursday.
