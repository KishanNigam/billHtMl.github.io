This is regarding User Story 2222, where we need to modify the BKSTMT_IMPORT VBScript so that specific BU fields (DEPT, BCLAS, and BILL) are hardcoded when an FX account (1232) line is created after loading the BAI file.

The question, raised by Desiree, is:
Are these changes applicable only for Concur sources (AP & APCNC), or do we need to cater to any other sources as well?

We need to confirm this before proceeding further.
