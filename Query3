I have configured the scenario for multiple files. To resolve the issue, I had to make changes to the batch file and the job. Iâ€™ve attached the batch file in DevOps, along with the Local Unit Testing document. Please review the job and batch file and give the go-ahead to QA for testing.
During testing, the transactions in the source file are being rejected. Could you please provide me with the correct source file so that I can test the job properly?
