As discussed over the call, the job configurations for BHSIEAS11 (test) environment and BHSIEAS10 (prod) environment are different. Therefore, I have made the necessary changes in BHSIEAS12.

Changes made:

Previously, when Scan 2 task was true, it was triggering ERROR 8. I have now updated it to trigger ERROR 2 instead.
Now, whenever there is a DB connection failure, the VC job email will send the Visual Cron log instead of the APPAY log.
I have uploaded the Visual Cron changes document to DevOps.

Kindly review it and let me know so that I can apply the same changes in Production.
Additionally, please confirm whether I should also fix these changes in the Test job.
