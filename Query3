Apologies for the inconvenience caused. The Summary jobs you noticed not completing or ending in error were part of the testing being conducted by QA and Dev under user story 2222. During testing, we had to intentionally fail the Summary jobs to validate various case scenarios.

Currently, the testing has been completed, and no further testing is being conducted at this time. You can proceed with your payment processing, and the system should function as expected without further interruptions.

If you encounter any issues or need additional support, please let me know.
