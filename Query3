Here is the translated and formalized version in English:

1. "The decryption batch and script have been deployed, and the process was successfully completed in the test environment."
2. "In UAT, the RUN_Decrypting job was created, and the deployed package was successfully implemented in the UAT environment."
3. "The same job was created in production, and the package was successfully deployed in the production environment."

Let me know if this works for you!
