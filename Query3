As per the discussion with Aarohi, she mentioned that if only the VC logs are attached regarding the DB timeout connection issue, then Pavan should add a comment on DevOps covering the following two points:

Business Justification – It should state that the changes made in VC will not impact the business.
Post-Deployment Monitoring – We will continue to observe the job after the changes are made in Production to ensure there is no impact.
In that case, we can proceed with closing the US after the changes are implemented in Production.
