As per the discussion, I have **added the .NET task to the job** and configured the code within it. After setting up the job flow, I placed the file in the **import location** for unit testing.  

However, while the **RRNG job is loading the source file**, it is **not triggering all tasks in the complete flow**. I am currently debugging this issue and will try to **resolve it by tomorrow**.
