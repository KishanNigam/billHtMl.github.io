This email refers to the work where I individually worked on multiple SQL queries, consolidated them, and created a stored procedure (SP). Additionally, I integrated this SP into a macro-enabled Excel file.

Currently, Lauren, Ashley, and the FSU team are actively using this automated Excel file for their daily operations.
