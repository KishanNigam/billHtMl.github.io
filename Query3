I had a discussion with Aarohi regarding the solution for splitting TCodes in BAI2. During the discussion, I performed a dry run of the code and demonstrated that even if the TCode is split, the implemented logic can still handle the issue. Aarohi agreed with the solution.  

### **Conclusion from the Discussion:**  
Currently, we have three issues that need to be addressed in phases:  

#### **Issue 1: TCode Missing in BAI2 File** (Phase 1)  
- Currently, when a TCode is missing in the BAI2 file for a transaction, the client reaches out and provides details about the missing TCode and the failed BAI2 load.  
- To handle this, we manually create the BAI2 file.  
- **Proposed Solution:** During BAI2 file loading, we will check whether all transactions have a TCode. If any TCode is missing, an error will be generated, logged, and a notification will be sent.  

#### **Issue 2: TCode Split into Two Lines** (Phase 2)  
- This issue has already been addressed through logic.  
- However, Aarohi suggested conducting more in-depth testing to validate the fix.  

#### **Issue 3: 'T' Missing in TCode** (Phase 3)  
- Sometimes, only the letter "T" is missing in the TCode within the BAI2 file.  
- Due to this, the BAI2 file loads successfully, but the posted payment file contains incorrect data.  
- **Proposed Solution:** We will check the first letter of the TCode for every transaction. If "T" is missing, it will be added automatically.  

All these issues and their resolution phases were decided by Aarohi. Our task is to implement these solutions and provide a walkthrough in a single consolidated file.  

### **Next Steps:**  
- I will start working on **Phase 1** from the next working day.  
- Additional efforts will be required to address all phases, and I have provided an estimated time for completion below.
