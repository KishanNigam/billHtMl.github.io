The **"Canceled Clear Job"** is **not passing the variable** to the **global job**, which caused the job to **not trigger** when **Kathy and the team** placed the file in the **source location**.

**"Debug Cancel Check"**  

Additionally, **Aarohi** has asked us to **debug and resolve this issue in the lower environment**, for which **US 23243** has been created in **DevOps**.
