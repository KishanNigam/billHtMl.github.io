I analyzed the OFAC job, and based on my analysis, we need to consider the timestamp of the log generated by the batch file (OFAC_YYYYMMDD_HHMM) and the timestamp of the Visual Cron log.  

So, whenever the Visual Cron log reads the batch log content, it should always pick the content from the latest batch log.  

Additionally, we should add a delay task to prevent job clashes during multiple runs.
