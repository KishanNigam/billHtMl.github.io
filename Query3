Based on the CIA document and confirmation from Divya, I have updated the code as per the BUCODEs provided for AP and APCNC. The development work is now complete, and unit testing is currently in progress.

During testing, Iâ€™m facing issues while using the transactions and BAI2 files related to AP and APCNC, which fall under Account No. 42002000.
I would require assistance from the BA team to proceed further with the testing.
