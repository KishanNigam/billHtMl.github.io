I have analyzed the OFAC job, and based on my analysis, we should use the timestamp format from the batch file logs (OFAC_YYYYMMDD_HHMM) and the Visual Cron logs (OFAC_YYYYMMDD).  

This approach is referenced from the MultiCheck upload job and other jobs where multiple run scenarios are applied.  

We can proceed with testing based on this logic. Please suggest your inputs.


I was on a continuous call regarding the currency extract issue, where I supported Mala with testing. Once Mala confirmed the smoke testing, I sent the production release email to Desiree.


Due to a medical emergency, I am logging out early today. Tomorrow, I need to take my father to the hospital as he has had a fever for the past two days. So, I will not be available tomorrow.
