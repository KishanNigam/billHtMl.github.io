**Subject**: Update on Client Project – SQL Automation Success

**Hi [Manager's Name],**

I wanted to share a quick update on the project I’ve been working on for our client. Initially, the client provided 8-9 separate SQL queries that needed to be analyzed. After thoroughly going through them, I managed to merge them into 3 efficient stored procedures. I also integrated these into Excel using macros, and I’ve delivered the final product to the client.

The client is now using these Excel sheets daily, which has automated the work they used to do manually. This automation is saving them a lot of time and making their process smoother.

Throughout this project:
- The client requested several changes, and I handled each one.
- At times, I did need to consult with seniors for guidance on specific issues, but in the end, I was able to solve the queries and deliver exactly what the client needed.

Overall, I’m happy with how it turned out, and it feels good knowing that the client is benefiting from this automation. I wanted to thank you and the team for the support during this project.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

Subject: Successful Delivery of Automated SQL Solution for Client

Dear [Manager's Name],

I would like to share an update on a recent project I completed for one of our clients. I was tasked with analyzing 8-9 SQL queries provided by the client and merging them into 3 optimized stored procedures. These procedures were then configured within Excel using macro code, which I successfully delivered to the client.

This solution is now being used by the client in their daily operations, automating processes that were previously done manually, significantly saving time and increasing efficiency.

During this project:

I received multiple requirement changes from the client, which I adapted and implemented accordingly.
In some cases, I consulted with seniors for guidance on complex requests.
Ultimately, I was able to independently finalize and deliver the required SQL queries and configurations.
I am proud of the outcome as it has provided the client with a streamlined, automated process, and I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on the journey and the support I received from the team.

Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project and for the support throughout the process.
