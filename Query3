During the discussion with Desiree, we reviewed two approaches to handle the summary lock.

**First Approach:** We would create a task containing a script with two queries. The first query selects the session ID, and the second query deletes the selected session ID. This task would then be added to the summary job.

**Second Approach:** We would create a new job using the same script.

After discussing both approaches, Desiree recommended proceeding with the new job option, as it would be more flexible for handling this type of error.
