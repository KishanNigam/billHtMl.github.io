I have completed the analysis of the **BAI2 script file** and explained the entire logic to Aarohi.  

Additionally, she has more questions that she wants clarity on, such as:  
1. **What is the role of queries in the script?**  
2. **How is the output file being written?**  

After discussing with her, I am continuing to work on the **script analysis**.  

Since this analysis will take considerable time, I will also start working on the **Sprint 26 user story** from tomorrow. I will be handling both tasks in parallel.
