I had a meeting until 9:45 PM, after which I completed the Visual Cron changes for the 399661-user story. Subsequently, I worked on the SYSDATA user story and had a meeting with Manoj and Aarohi to discuss further details.

After 1:30 AM, I wasnâ€™t feeling well, so I focused on delivering the tasks mentioned above.

Today, I plan to complete all remaining work related to the SYSDATA user story.
