We have created a new job to upload the VNDLY export file to the SFTP location.

Could you please check as per the details below and confirm whether the file has been successfully uploaded?

Looking forward to your confirmation.


As Brian mentioned in the request, the password has now become public. Therefore, we need to ask the bank to update the password again and ensure that it is shared privately with Brian.
