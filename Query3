"Our HSBC BAI2 Import job on BHSIEAS10 is experiencing long-running issues. The last time we encountered this, we identified a performance issue with `BSTRN_DETAIL_KEY2 State` and implemented a weekly refresh as a solution.

Could you please check why this issue is recurring even after the weekly refresh? Additionally, can we consider scheduling this refresh on a daily basis?"
