Test Cases and Scenarios
1. File and Parameter Validation
Test Case ID	Scenario	Expected Result
TC01	Source file Session_lock.txt is missing	Script logs: "Error: Source file is not available or Source file name is not correct." and exits.
TC02	Source file exists but JOB_ID and LOCK_SESSION_ID are missing	Script logs: "No JOB_ID provided. Skipping update query." and "No LOCK_SESSION_ID provided. Skipping delete query."
TC03	No parameters passed to the script	Script logs: "Missing parameters" and exits.
TC04	Invalid parameters passed to the script	Script behaves as intended for valid logic, ignoring irrelevant input.
2. JOB_ID Validation
Test Case ID	Scenario	Expected Result
TC05	Single valid JOB_ID provided	Script updates the record, logs success, and completes.
TC06	Single invalid JOB_ID provided	Script logs: "Error: JOB_ID [value] is wrong!" and exits.
TC07	Multiple valid JOB_ID values provided	Script updates all records, logs success for each, and completes.
TC08	Multiple JOB_ID values with one invalid (e.g., JOB_ID=123,INVALID)	Script logs: "Error: JOB_ID [value] is wrong!" for the invalid value and exits without updating any records.
TC09	No JOB_ID provided	Script logs: "No JOB_ID provided. Skipping update query."
3. LOCK_SESSION_ID Validation
Test Case ID	Scenario	Expected Result
TC10	Valid LOCK_SESSION_ID provided	Script deletes the record, logs success, and completes.
TC11	Invalid LOCK_SESSION_ID provided	Script logs: "Error: LOCK_SESSION_ID is wrong!" but continues with other tasks.
TC12	No LOCK_SESSION_ID provided	Script logs: "No LOCK_SESSION_ID provided. Skipping delete query."
4. Database Connection
Test Case ID	Scenario	Expected Result
TC13	Valid database connection parameters	Script connects to the database successfully and executes queries.
TC14	Invalid database connection parameters	Script logs: "Error: Database Issue - [description]" and exits.
TC15	Network issue causing database connection failure	Script logs: "Error: Database Issue - [description]" and exits.
5. Mixed Scenarios
Test Case ID	Scenario	Expected Result
TC16	Both JOB_ID and LOCK_SESSION_ID are valid	Script updates and deletes records, logs success, and completes.
TC17	Valid JOB_ID with invalid LOCK_SESSION_ID	Script updates records for JOB_ID, logs error for LOCK_SESSION_ID, and completes.
TC18	Invalid JOB_ID with valid LOCK_SESSION_ID	Script logs error for JOB_ID, skips updates, deletes record for LOCK_SESSION_ID, and completes.
TC19	Both JOB_ID and LOCK_SESSION_ID are invalid	Script logs errors for both, skips all operations, and exits.
TC20	Empty Session_lock.txt file	Script logs: "No JOB_ID provided. Skipping update query." and "No LOCK_SESSION_ID provided. Skipping delete query."
6. Logging Validation
Test Case ID	Scenario	Expected Result
TC21	Successful execution of all tasks	Log file contains all success messages and timestamped logs.
TC22	Error occurs during JOB_ID validation	Log file contains the error message: "Error: JOB_ID [value] is wrong!"
TC23	Error occurs during database connection	Log file contains the error message: "Error: Database Issue - [description]"
7. Error Handling
Test Case ID	Scenario	Expected Result
TC24	Unexpected error during query execution	Script logs the error and exits gracefully.
TC25	Invalid SQL query in the script	Script logs: "Error: Database Issue - [description]" and exits.
8. Edge Cases
Test Case ID	Scenario	Expected Result
TC26	Extra spaces or special characters in JOB_ID or LOCK_SESSION_ID values	Script trims spaces, processes valid values, and logs errors for invalid ones.
TC27	Session_lock.txt file contains duplicate JOB_ID or LOCK_SESSION_ID values	Script processes each value independently and does not fail.
TC28	Very large number of JOB_ID values provided	Script processes all values without performance issues.
