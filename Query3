1. Added support for multiple `JOB_ID` values, validating each individually.  
2. If any `JOB_ID` is invalid, the script stops and logs an error: `"Error: JOB_ID [value] is wrong!"`.  
3. Enhanced logging for all actions, including missing files, database errors, and invalid IDs.  
4. Database connection errors are handled gracefully with proper logging and exit codes.  
5. Tested and compatible with the Visual Cron job setup.


"I have attached the technical document; please review it.

I have made updates to the code to handle error scenarios, including wrong job ID and additional negative scenarios.  
I have also attached the 'Code Test Case Scenario.docx' document, which details all the error-handling cases managed by the code."






"The code is handling all negative error scenarios correctly. However, the Visual Cron script is not throwing an error even after reading the error from the script log. I have applied the necessary condition, but could you please check why the condition in Visual Cron is not working as expected?"
