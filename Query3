I have completed the technical analysis of the script code.

Based on the source and requirements provided in the CIA, I have updated the code in the script. As a result, the XML will now display the beneficiary bank account number in place of the IBAN code.

However, when I ran the code locally for unit testing, I found that no bank account value was appearing in place of the IBAN in the XML. Upon debugging and executing the script in SSMS, I discovered that the beneficiary bank account field is encrypted, which is why the bank account number is not being displayed.

As the next step, I sought approval from Aarohi to deploy the script in the Test environment. However, I was only able to deploy it in the DEV environment since I do not have access to deploy it in Test.

Currently, all script code changes have been completed as per the CIA. I can proceed with unit testing only after the deployment in the Test environment.
