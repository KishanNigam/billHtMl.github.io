Based on today’s call and our previous discussions, here is the final conclusion to update in the DevOps user story:

Objective: Handle summary lock issues effectively to prevent job failures.

Approaches Discussed:

Add Tasks within the Summary Job: Proposed to streamline by adding tasks directly in the summary job, which would include:
A task to identify and delete the session lock, executed only if the summary job encounters a lock issue.
Create a New Job: Preferred by Desiree for its flexibility in handling similar errors independently.
Decision: Desiree recommended creating a new job with the same script to handle session locks, which will offer better adaptability.

Failure Handling Steps (If Summary Job Fails):

Stop the job immediately.
Update the job status to “error.”
Delete the session lock to allow retry or further actions.
