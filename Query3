Lauren reached out regarding the FABCE import job not triggering when the file was placed. The reason identified was that Lauren renamed the file to the source filename after placing it.

When I placed the file, the job triggered successfully, and the data was also loaded into EAS. However, I noticed that the file was not moving to the archive location. Upon investigation, I found that there is some extra space in the archive variable within the batch file.

Please look into this issue. For now, I have manually moved the source file to the archive location.
