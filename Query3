### **Technical Analysis of the VBScript**

Below is a detailed point-to-point technical analysis of the VBScript, incorporating its objective, mechanisms, and error handling strategies. This analysis considers the Visual Cron job executing a batch file that calls the VBScript.

---

### **1. Objective**
The VBScript is designed to perform the following tasks:
1. Read `JOB_ID` and `LOCK_SESSION_ID` values from a source file `Session_lock.txt`.
2. Use these values to execute SQL `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations on a database:
   - Update records in the `EAS_JOBS` table using `JOB_ID`.
   - Delete records from the `EAS_LOCKS` table using `LOCK_SESSION_ID`.
3. Handle multiple `JOB_ID` values, validating each, stopping if any are invalid, and logging errors.
4. Ensure robust error handling for missing files, invalid parameters, database connectivity, and query execution errors.
5. Log detailed activity and errors with timestamps for auditing and debugging.

---

### **2. Script Mechanism**
Below is the step-by-step mechanism of the script:

#### **2.1 Start Block**
- **Purpose:** Initialize the script and validate prerequisites.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Set up logging to record all activities with timestamps.
  - Verify the existence of the source file `Session_lock.txt`. If the file is missing, log an error and exit.
  - Read the contents of `Session_lock.txt` to extract `JOB_ID` and `LOCK_SESSION_ID`.

---

#### **2.2 Reading Input Parameters**
- **Mechanism:**
  - Use file reading to fetch `JOB_ID` and `LOCK_SESSION_ID` values.
  - Parse the values and assign them to respective variables (`JOB_ID_1`, `JOB_ID_2`, etc.).
  - Handle scenarios where `JOB_ID` or `LOCK_SESSION_ID` are missing:
    - Log: "No JOB_ID provided. Skipping update query."
    - Log: "No LOCK_SESSION_ID provided. Skipping delete query."

---

#### **2.3 Validating and Processing Multiple `JOB_ID`**
- **Mechanism:**
  - Split multiple `JOB_ID` values if they exist (e.g., `123,456`).
  - Validate each `JOB_ID`:
    - If valid, execute the `UPDATE` query for the record.
    - If invalid, log: "Error: JOB_ID [value] is wrong!" and stop further execution.
  - Use a loop to process each `JOB_ID` one by one.

---

#### **2.4 Executing SQL Queries**
- **Database Connection:**
  - Establish a connection using predefined parameters (`sConnect`).
  - Validate the connection and log any issues.
- **Query Execution:**
  - Execute `UPDATE` for `JOB_ID`.
  - Execute `DELETE` for `LOCK_SESSION_ID`.
  - Log the success of each operation with timestamps.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Catch and log database errors, specifying the SQL operation and error description.

---

#### **2.5 End Block**
- **Purpose:** Clean up resources and log completion.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Close the database connection.
  - Write a final log entry indicating successful completion or a summary of errors.

### **3. Error Handling**

| **Error Type**                              | **Handling Mechanism**                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **File Missing**                            | Log: "Error: Source file is not available or Source file name is not correct." Script exits gracefully.      |
| **Empty or Missing Parameters**             | Log specific messages for missing `JOB_ID` or `LOCK_SESSION_ID` and skip related operations.                |
| **Invalid `JOB_ID` or `LOCK_SESSION_ID`**   | Log: "Error: JOB_ID [value] is wrong!" and stop further execution for `JOB_ID`. Continue for `LOCK_SESSION_ID`.|
| **Database Connection Failure**             | Log: "Error: Database Issue - [description]" and exit the script.                                           |
| **SQL Query Execution Error**               | Log: "Error during SQL Execution for [operation]: [description]" and skip the operation.                    |
| **Unexpected Errors**                       | Use a generic error-handling mechanism (`On Error Resume Next` and `Err.Number`) to log and exit gracefully.|

### **4. Script Logic Overview**

1. **Start Block:**
   - Initialize the log file and variables.
   - Validate input file and read its contents.
2. **Input Validation:**
   - Ensure `JOB_ID` and `LOCK_SESSION_ID` are present.
   - Split and validate multiple `JOB_ID` values.
3. **Database Operations:**
   - Connect to the database.
   - Perform SQL operations (`UPDATE` and `DELETE`).
   - Log success or errors for each operation.
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle missing files, invalid parameters, and database issues.
5. **Logging:**
   - Record all actions, errors, and results with timestamps.
6. **End Block:**
   - Close the database connection and finalize the log.

---

### **5. Logging Details**
- **Log Entries:**
  - Start time of the script.
  - Results of file validation.
  - Details of each `JOB_ID` and `LOCK_SESSION_ID` operation.
  - Errors encountered (e.g., invalid IDs, database issues).
  - Final summary and end time.
- **Example Log:**
  ```
  [2024-11-25 08:00:00] Script started.
  [2024-11-25 08:01:00] JOB_ID 123 updated successfully.
  [2024-11-25 08:01:30] Error: JOB_ID 456 is wrong!
  [2024-11-25 08:02:00] LOCK_SESSION_ID 789 deleted successfully.
  [2024-11-25 08:03:00] Script completed with errors.
  ```

### **6. Visual Cron Integration**
- **Job Execution Flow:**
  1. Visual Cron triggers the batch file (`.bat`).
  2. The batch file executes the VBScript.
  3. VBScript performs the database operations and logs results.
- **Error Handling in Visual Cron:**
  - If the VBScript returns an error (non-zero exit code), Visual Cron logs the failure and can trigger alerts or retries.

---

### **7. Benefits of Updated Script**
1. Supports multiple `JOB_ID` values.
2. Robust error handling for individual IDs.
3. Detailed logging for debugging and auditing.
4. Graceful handling of missing or invalid inputs.
5. Compatible with Visual Cron for automated execution.
