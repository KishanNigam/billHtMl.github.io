Certainly! Here are the four cases explained in bullet points:

---

### ✅ **Case 1: Valid CREF Value Present**

- **TRANSDESC**: `"1443211386250121/CREF/2214/BNF/SERNETZ"`

- **Condition**: `/CREF/` is present, and the value following it is valid (`2214`).

- **Result**: `HSBCREF` is assigned the value `2214`.

---

### ✅ **Case 2: CREF Not Present**

- **TRANSDESC**: `"1443211386250121/BNF/SERNETZ"`

- **Condition**: `/CREF/` is not present in the string.

- **Result**: `HSBCREF` is assigned the value of `CUSTREF`.

---

### ✅ **Case 3: CREF Present but Value is Blank**

- **TRANSDESC**: `"1443211386250121/CREF/ /BNF/SERNETZ"`

- **Condition**: `/CREF/` is present, but the value following it is a space (i.e., blank).

- **Result**: `HSBCREF` is assigned the value of `CUSTREF`.

---

### ✅ **Case 4: CREF Present but Value is Missing**

- **TRANSDESC**: `"1443211386250121/CREF//BNF/SERNETZ"`

- **Condition**: `/CREF/` is present, but there is no value between the slashes (i.e., empty).

- **Result**: `HSBCREF` is assigned the value of `CUSTREF`.

These cases ensure that the script accurately assigns `HSBCREF` based on the presence and validity of the CREF value in `TRANSDESC`.
