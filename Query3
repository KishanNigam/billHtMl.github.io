Hi Brian,

I had a discussion with Pavan, where he mentioned that when we are uploading a file inside the Uploads folder through the Explorer tab and then refreshing the folder, the file disappears.

However, when we follow the same process in the Downloads folder, the file remains even after refreshing.
