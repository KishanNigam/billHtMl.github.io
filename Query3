Describe the Change Being Requested:

Request here is to update job HSBC BAI2 IMPORT – International- RUN_BHSI-BAI2-IMPORT.bat file to copy the Posted payment files in Reporting solution location as well in NICO Server.
1. APPLICATION INTRODUCTION: 
As a central data repository for financial information, EAS Application is the source for accounting, reconciliation, budget information, allocations, and accounts payable.
•	DESCRIBED BELOW IS THE EXISTING AP PROCESS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE TESTER WHILE TESTING


•	Execute the D:\EAS\Server\Custom\bat\RUN_BHSI-BAI2-IMPORT.bat batch file.  This batch file executes D:\EAS\Server\Custom\bin\BKSTMT_IMPORT.VBS\.  Afterwards, the batch file executes RRNG.exe and VALDLOAD.EXE.


2. Current process: -
Currently Posted Payment and Outstanding Payment files is saved under G:\Finance\BHSIC CASH\Daily_Feeds\HSBC_Data, once BAI loaded into EAS.
