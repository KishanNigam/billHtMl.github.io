We connected with Alex, and when we tried loading the file through the Upload Job, Alex confirmed that the file was not found in the SFTP file location.  

We are analyzing the VNDLY Upload Job to identify the issue.  

Additionally, we have asked Alex to place the file in the SFTP download location so that we can verify the end-to-end process.
