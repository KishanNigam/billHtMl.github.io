**Subject:** Deployment Access Issue in Octopus Pipeline  

Hi [Recipient's Name],  

Yesterday, I deployed a new file and was testing the Octopus pipeline. While I was able to successfully commit the code, the deployment is not proceeding in Octopus due to an access issue.  

I have reached out to Cris regarding this, and he is currently working on resolving the issue.  

Please let me know if you need any further details.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
