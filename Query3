1. Added support for multiple `JOB_ID` values, validating each individually.  
2. If any `JOB_ID` is invalid, the script stops and logs an error: `"Error: JOB_ID [value] is wrong!"`.  
3. Enhanced logging for all actions, including missing files, database errors, and invalid IDs.  
4. Database connection errors are handled gracefully with proper logging and exit codes.  
5. Tested and compatible with the Visual Cron job setup.


"I have attached the technical document; please review it.

I have made updates to the code to handle error scenarios, including wrong job ID and additional negative scenarios.  
I have also attached the 'Code Test Case Scenario.docx' document, which details all the error-handling cases managed by the code."
