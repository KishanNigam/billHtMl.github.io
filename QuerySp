Subject: New Job Creation and CIA Update Requirements

Summary of Discussion
As we discussed, we will proceed with the new job setup. Below are the steps to handle the New Job Summary Lock.

Job Objective
The job will:

Retrieve the JOB_ID of a stuck summary job from a source file and change its status from "started" to "Errored."
Read the EAS_LOCK table and remove any lock entries if they exist.
Technical Steps
Analysis and Extraction of Stuck Summary Job ID

Analyze the summary job failure, retrieve the JOB_ID of the stuck summary job from the EAS_JOBS table, and store this ID in a TXT file.
Save this TXT file at a specified location (referred to as the SOURCE FILE and SOURCE PATH).
Run the Job

After placing the SOURCE FILE, proceed to run the job.
Execute the Batch (BAT) File

The BAT file will:
Log its operations and move the SOURCE FILE to the archive location.
Call the VBScript.
Execute the VBScript

The VBScript will:
Assign the retrieved JOB_ID from the SOURCE FILE to a variable, then run an update query to set the status of the stuck summary job to "Errored."
Read the EAS_LOCK table; if any lock entries are found, they will be deleted.

Document all steps in the log for record-keeping.
