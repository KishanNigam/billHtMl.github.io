when I passed multiple value for JOB_ID its not updated STATUS_IND. I think in the query start and end single ' is not applied "UPDATE EAS_JOBS SET STATUS_IND = 300 WHERE JOB_ID IN (208862','208846)"

THis log printed msg:
Handle Lock Script started. Source Path: \\nicoeas12\Server\log\Deployment\Summery_LOCK\SourceDIR\ | Date: 11/14/2024 11:36:30 AM
   
JOB_ID fetched: 208862,208846
LOCK_SESSION_ID fetched: 3668314
Executing update query: UPDATE EAS_JOBS SET STATUS_IND = 300 WHERE JOB_ID IN (208862','208846)

Kindly fix only this thing. do not change any thing.
