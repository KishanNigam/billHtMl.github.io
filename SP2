I had a discussion with Aarohi, and she would like to review the following scenarios:

Behavior of the EAS_LOCK Table During Summary Job Execution

Determine if locks are created exclusively for the summary job in the EAS_LOCK table while it is running, or if locks for other processes can also appear in the table simultaneously.
EAS_JOBS Table Entry and Status for Subsequent Summary Jobs

In the EAS_JOBS table: If the first summary job fails and we run the second job manually, will there be an entry for the third summary job in the EAS_JOBS table? If so, what would be the STATUS_IND value for this entry?
